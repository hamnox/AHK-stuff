# AHK-stuff
Ahh, the memories of stuff I used to do in this language.

This is so defunct, I don't even know what verison of AutoHotKey was capable of running it.

It moves and hides windows by text commands, lets me launch stuff as if from an invisible command line, shows a message with "secret" native windows applications I can run.
At one point I even hacked a complex doohickey to run a partial match search-and-launch.

Basically, my deprived, mac-less childhood left me yearning for a Spotlight Search I never how to name.
